This Python 3.x module provides a class for applying regular expressions. 

If run as a script, it will take an input file (plain text) and a set of regexes saved 
as a text file (a sample file is provided) and will output a converted text file. You 
can specify these files via the command line, or else just name your input file to match the 
provided default.
If you use it often, you can 'install' it by adding the SFMUtils folder to your Windows PATH. 
Appending ";.PY;.PYW" to the PATHEXT variable will allow you to leave off the ".py" . More details here:

Sample command-line calls (the first just displays help, the second converts 
input.txt to output.txt, overwriting it if it's there):
python ApplyRE.py -h
python ApplyRE.py -o input.txt output.txt

In Windows, you may want to create a batch file that you can easily double-click to run this. But don't name it ApplyRE.bat
Example 1:
python ApplyRE.py -o
pause
Example 2:
C:\Python32\python.exe ApplyRE.py "C:\temp\myfile.txt" "C:\temp\out.txt" -o
pause
