Checked (very roughly) the relative order of ps and sn (Having a mix of hierarchies is bad! Standard MDF has ps above one or more sn, but limiting it to one sn per ps imports better into FLEx. LT-9353 LT-10739):
  ps occurred first in 0 records
  sn occurred first in 0 records
  neither one occurred in 15 records
Checked roughly for missing ps; it is missing in 15 records.
In both cases, only checked records, not individual senses/subentries.
WARNING: If importing into FLEx, empty ps fields are a problem. If you have any, consider using find/replace to insert an explicit 'unknown' value (LT-10739, LT-14038).
